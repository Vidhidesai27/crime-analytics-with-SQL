This project simulates a relational database for crime investigation using SQL. It models complex relationships between crimes, suspects, officers, forensics, and crime scenes to demonstrate how data supports law enforcement analytics.


## 🧱 Key Features
- 29+ relational tables in 3rd Normal Form (3NF)
- Subtypes: Robbery, Homicide, Suicide, Kidnapping
- Many-to-Many relationships: Crimes ↔ Suspects
- Multivalued attributes: Aliases, Affiliations, Evidence
- Mock data generated using Mockaroo
- Enhanced ER Diagram design and SQL implementation

## 🔍 Example Analytical Queries
- Identify suspects at large with affiliations
- Detect fatal injuries linked to drugs
- Track high-risk crime locations
- List high-ransom unresolved kidnapping cases

## 📁 Files Included
